    <h2>Ember Lumen</h2>
    <p>Ember Lumen is fiery… and not just because she’s a Fire element. She’s tough, quick-witted, smart, and a bit hot-headed. But, as the only child of immigrant parents, Ember is keenly aware of how much they sacrificed to give her a better life. Because of that, she is dedicated to repaying them by being a perfect daughter. That is, until she meets Wade, a Water element whose different perspective on life prompts Ember to ask some burning questions about her place in the world.</p>
